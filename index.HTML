      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Developed by Arrowhead Studios and published by Sony, Helldivers is a top-down squad shooter set in a dystopian future where mankind is ruled by a managed democracy. As part of the elite unit called the Helldivers, players must work together to protect Super Earth and defeat the enemies of mankind in an intense intergalactic war. Released as a cross-buy on PS4, PS3 and PS Vita systems in March 2015, Helldivers features cross-play and cross-save for those platforms. It was later released to Windows via Steam in early December 2015.</p>
      <p>With cooperative, squad-based gunplay, Helldivers supports 2-4 player online or local play, peppered with voice chat and friendly fire alike. Helldivers is one of the few console games to support cross-platform online play, so players on the PS3, PS4 and PS Vita can all play together, though cross-platform play between these versions and the PC is not permitted. Even so, all platforms share progress and influence for the Galactic Campaign.</p>
