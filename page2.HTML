      <h1>Politics</h1>
      <h2>Voting system</h2>
      <p>"Mankind has improved upon the old concept of Democracy. Utilizing computer aided voting software, citizens are asked to answer several questions, and the outcome of their vote is decided upon by the computer. This removes the uncertainty that existed in the old systems where voters didn't understand fully what they were voting for, giving us Managed Democracy." - Encyclopedia Description   
        Citizens of the federation of Super Earth use automated voting software; they answer a few questions on the Galactic Wide Web (GWW) and the computer votes for them based on that outcome. The GWW is a network of interlinked communication devices that transmit data using quantum communication, "very elementary stuff" according to the ship's C.O.</p>
      <h2>Political climate</h2>  
      <p>It is made very clear at several points in the game itself and in some of its DLC's descriptions that the government of Super Earth has a history of brutally suppressing dissidents:

        The Super Earth broadcast screen states that: "Questions regarding the Federation or Government of Super Earth shall be sent to the appropriate quadrant. It is illegal to express oneself openly about the Federation or Government of Super Earth in a negative manner and serious cases may result in arrest or termination. Brought to you by Super Earth Pt Ltd. Sponsored by Super Earth."
        One of the Privates on the ship's bridge mentioned that their neighbor apparently pressed charges on their son for not honoring the Super Earth flag, implying that is considered a crime serious enough to warrant turning in one's own close family members.
        The ship's C.O. states that all communications over the Galactic Wide Web (GWW) are continuously monitored by Super Earth in search of "alien sympathizers".
        Citizens who doubt whether the terrorist bombings Super Earth uses as a justification to attack the Cyborgs are actually caused by anyone affiliated with the Cyborg Nation are decried as "Cyborg sympathizers". Those who wish for peace talks with the Cyborgs are painted as "hippies" and Senator John W. Killjoy threatens to have them jailed or even executed.
        The first use of the iconic Hellpods was when the socialist government of Northman's Creek tried to secede from the federation of Super Earth. After fifty Helldivers dropped into the Parliament, they were quickly executed and the planet brought into compliance. These days, Northman's Creek is the region capital of the Struve Region on the Bug front.
        The MP-98 Knight SMG is "often used by the Ministry of Defence to rapidly incapacitate groups of wrong-thinkers".
        The Defenders' signature weapon is the aptly-nicknamed CR-9 Suppressor, a semi/full auto rifle firing small fragmentation grenades that can devastate large masses of enemies. Their AD-334 Guard Dog drones are most effective against unarmored targets, firing indiscriminately at anything deemed hostile.
        The Ranger Pack DLC description mentions that "Ranger training was standard procedure for all Helldivers in the early years of Super Earth, but has now become rarer". From the Defender Pack DLC description, we know that "Helldiver Defenders used to double as riot police before humanity unified properly".
        The above means it's likely that (a portion of) early Super Earth riot police were fully-trained military assassination and reconnaisance specialists before Super Earth unified -- and that the Ministry of Defence also either acted as a police force or supplemented it.
        
        Fun fact: the TOX-13 Avenger was "developed by Dr. Junko under the 2079 act of self-defence research and has been tested extensively on live targets". The DLC description for the Hazard Ops Pack also notes the following: "Sometimes shunned by fellow Helldivers for their use of inhumane warfare, many a Helldiver is happy to have them on the mission when it comes down to life or death. It's not like the enemy is Human after all."</p>
