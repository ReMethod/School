      <h1>Liberty Day</h1>
      <p>Liberty Day is celebrated by the citizens of Super Earth on the 26th of October. The HELLDIVERS community also celebrates Liberty Day. Arrowhead Studios has released free DLC, available to everyone, on this date consistently (as of 2018).
        Every citizen of Super Earth is issued a ceremonial (but functional) M2016 Constitution bolt-action rifle when they turn 16, to encourage military service. The government is giving out free weapons to get its young citizens used to handling a firearm, which implies a highly militaristic society.
        The C1-PERM (pronounced "cee-one-perm") is required for citizens of Super Earth to legally reproduce. According to the NPC Privates on the ship's bridge, these forms are not that easy to fill out. Interestingly, the female Private also mentions having a wife (in text, but not in the spoken dialogue). If this is not an oversight (considering that the Privates mostly have the same lines), it can be inferred that same-sex relationships are not considered a taboo in Super Earth culture.</p>
